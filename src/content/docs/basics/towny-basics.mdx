Towny is the core of gameplay on LumaMC. It allows players to create towns, nations, and outposts,
and manage them with a variety of commands. Towny is a complex plugin, but it's easy to get the hang
of once you understand the basics!

### With towns you can...

<div class="list">

- Claim land. (Unclaimed land still adheres to our griefing [rules](https://lumamc.net/rules)!)
- Invite other players to be residents.
- Set up a town bank.
- Set up a town spawn.
- Create embassies in other towns.
- Create 'outposts' in the wilderness that allow you to claim more land. (You can also teleport to
  their spawns!)
- Set up a town tax.
- Set up a town plot system.
- Communicate and chat with other town members using `/tc`.

</div>

### With nations you can...

<div class="list">

- Invite towns to join your nation.
- Set up a nation bank.
- Set up a nation spawn.
- Set up a nation tax.
- Communicate and chat with other nation members using `/nc`.

</div>

### Town ranks

Town ranks allow players to have different permissions within a town. For example, you can have a
player who can invite others to the town, but not kick them. You can also have a player who can
manage the town's bank, but not claim land. Ranks can added or removed from players using the
`/t rank add <player>` command.

<div class="list">

Available **Town Ranks**:

- Mayor
- Co-Mayor
- Helper
- Sheriff
- Default (All residents automatically have this rank and it cannot be applied or removed.)

Available **Nation Ranks**:

- King
- Assistant
- Helper
- Default (All members automatically have this rank and it cannot be applied or removed.)

</div>

## Plots

Plots are an important part of Towny and general claiming on Luma. Players often get stuck when
trying to make specific town plots available to certain players or to the general public, so here's
a quick guide on how to do that!

#### What is a plot?

A plot is a single chunk claimed by yours or another town. Plots can be sold, rented, or given to
players to build on.

**Allowing a plot to spawn mobs, have firespread, have explosions, or other destructive actions:**

<div class="list">

- `/plot toggle <explosion|fire|mobs|pvp|taxed>` - Toggles the specific setting on the plot.
- `/plot set perm <ally|friend|nation|outsider|...> <build|destroy|switch|itemuse>` - Sets a
  specific permission for a group of players on the plot.
- `/plot group <group> <args>` - Sets an option for a plot **group**.
- `/plot trust add <player>` - Trusts a player to the plot, allowing them to build and interact
  within the plot.
- `/plot trust remove <player>` - Removes a player's trust from the plot.
- `/plot set reset` - Resets the plot to default settings.
- `/plot claim` - Claims a plot for **you** disallowing other normal residents from interacting with
  the plot.
- `/plot unclaim` - Unclaims a plot for **you** allowing other normal residents to interact with the
  plot again.
- `/plot info` - Shows information about the plot you're standing in.

</div>

## Outposts

Outposts can be used to claim areas not directly linked to your town! Here are some commands
regarding outposts:

- `/t outpost claim` - Allows the town to claim an outpost
- `/t outpost list` - Lists all the towns outposts
- `/plot set outpost` - Sets the plot as an outpost

## Upkeep

Town upkeep is a part of town maintenance. If you fail to pay your town upkeep, the town will fall
into ruin! You can pay your towny upkeep by putting money into your town bank using
`/t deposit <amount>`. Check your current upkeep costs with `/t`. See exact prices with
`/towny prices`.

## Managing Residents

Managing residents is an important part of towny. Here are some guides on how to manage residents!

### Inviting new residents

You can invite players to your town using `/t invite <player>`! The player can accept using
`/accept`. Invites will stay active until they are rejected or expire.

## Chest Protections

In addition to Towny's claim protections, we use **Bolt** to protect chests and other containers. By
default **all** chests are protected inside towns and out in the wilderness. See our guide for chest
protections below!
