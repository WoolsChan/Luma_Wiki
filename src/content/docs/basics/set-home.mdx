LumaMC offers players the ability to set a home at any location, allowing you to teleport there at any time with commands.
At the beginning you will only have one home, but more can be obtained through in-game ranks or store ranks. 

### Common Commands

- `/set home <desired home?>` - Creates a home you can teleport to
- `/home <home?>` - Teleport to a home you've made
- `/homes` - Shows a list of your saved homes
- `/delhome <home?>` - Delete a saved home
