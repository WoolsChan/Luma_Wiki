### PvP Guidelines

  permission will result in punishment when reported.
- Utilize `/pvp` to ensure you don't lose items or experience points while engaging in friendly
  battles.

Strictly prohibited redstone devices or machines are:**

- Zero tick farms.
- Auto-brewers and cookers are permitted within redstone limits, as long as they do not cause
  immense lag.

**Any redstone machine or farm that causes significant lag to the server will be removed without
warning.**

### Unfair Advantages

cheating, staff will take action.**

- Mods that grant players an unfair advantage. If uncertain about a mod's permissibility, please

regarding real-world trading:**

- IRL Trading (in-game money/items for real money) is strictly prohibited on Luma.
- Payments conducted outside of our platforms cannot be tracked or confirmed by us.
- Trading [store](https://store.lumamc.net) items for in-game money or items is permissible as it is
  trackable and kept within Luma.

### Policy on Scamming

**The act of scamming in any form is strictly prohibited. This encompasses, but is not limited to:**

- Taking advantage of new players.
- Selling goods for an unreasonable amount of money, including listing items at exorbitant prices
  under the guise of "donation" items.

- Exploiting clearly incorrect pricing from a player, such as intentionally leaving a zero off a
  chest shop price.
- Failure to fulfill agreements in player-to-player deals, the job must be completed, and the worker
  must be paid the full agreed-upon amount.

### Reporting Procedures

- Directly report any players breaking rules to staff, providing proof/evidence whenever possible
  through our discord tickets.
- If reporting a staff member, please message an admin directly via Discord.
- Multiple false reports lacking evidence may lead to punitive measures.
- Avoid creating blank tickets; instead, promptly respond with details regarding your issue.

### Mute & Ban Policies

- It is strictly prohibited to work around a mute. This includes using signs, books, paper, or any
  other method to communicate with players in-game.
- If you react negatively while muted, your punishment may be escalated. It is crucial to address
  the issue directly with staff in private channels.
- For appeals, please use Discord and submit a ticket. Refrain from reaching out to staff members
  directly for this purpose.

### Creativity Policy

- Inappropriate usernames or skins may result in a ban until they are changed.
- The use of inappropriate or disrespectful names, skins, tags, map art, signs, pixel art, books,
  etc. (anything customizable) is not allowed.
- Renamed or edited items should not result in chat spam when showcased; hence, names and lores must
  not be excessively long.

**When in doubt, it is recommended to seek guidance from any staff member.**

### Policy on Alternative Accounts

**Using multiple accounts, also known as alts, is strictly prohibited within our community due to
the unfair advantages they provide. Rules against this include:**

- Account sharing.
- Utilizing an alternate account to evade a ban.
- Leveraging an alternative account for unfair advantages, such as claiming referral rewards or
  acquiring additional event items.
- If found using another account to gain extra event rewards of advantages, your main account will
  be banned for a minimum of the duration of the event.
- If you have multiple friends/family in your household please let a staff member know or open a
  ticket.

**TL;DR, one account per person.**

### Punishment Policy

- Punishments are handled on a case-by-case basis, and no two instances of rule-breaking will
  necessarily receive the same punishment.
- Previous punishments (including warnings) may be considered when determining consequences,
  especially if there is a lack of behavioral improvement.
- Any attempt to evade punishments is strictly against the rules.
- Staff members reserve the right to administer punishments based on any grounds they deem
  necessary. If you feel a punishment is made unfairly, make a ticket on our
  [discord](https://lumamc.net/chat) to appeal or directly message an admin to report a staff
  member.

**Conversations with other players, regardless of the setting related to the server, are subject to
the same rules. This includes:**

- Direct messages (DMs) between two LumaMC players.
- Discord channels created specifically for any Town in-game.
